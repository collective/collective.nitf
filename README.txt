Introduction
============

    News articles in Plone are instances of the 'News Item' content type: they
    can contain a title, a description, a body text, an image and some basic
    metadata. If you publish a couple of items from time to time, this is
    fine.

    But suppose you have to publish dozens of items everyday... How do you
    tell your readers who they are about? What do they cover? Where do they
    took place? And, more important, how do you classify them? How do you
    organize them? How do you tell your readers which ones are newsworthy?

    To solve these, and other issues, the "IPTC":http://www.iptc.org
    developed XML standards to define the content and structure of news
    articles. "NITF":http://www.nitf.org, "NewsML":http://www.newsml.org and
    "NewsCodes":http://www.iptc.org/NewsCodes/ are among these standards and
    they support the classification, identification and description of a huge
    number of news articles characteristics.

    NITF is intended to structure independent news articles and this package
    aims to implement a content type inspired by the specification.
